Helloooo, I'm Vandam!!!!! I'm currently studying engineering mathematics at Bristol university for my fifth and final year. I worked at Dyson for my placement year and I fell in love with programming.

It's such a beautiful thing to create and I'm so grateful to be able to. It's so fun!!!! I've been experimenting a lot lately with making apps and websites.

In my free time I love to watch movies, listening/creating music, bouldering and being in nature.
