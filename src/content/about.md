Hey! I'm a 22 year old software engineer based in Bristol, UK. I'm currently studying Engineering Mathematics at Bristol University for my fifth year.

I was prev. working at Dyson, solving robotic-simulation-esque problems along with some MyDyson cloud stuff too.

In my free time I love to watch movies, listening/creating music, bouldering and being in nature.
