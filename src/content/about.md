Hey! I'm a 22 year old software engineer based in Bristol, UK. I'm currently studying Engineering Mathematics at Bristol University for my fourth year.

I was prev. working at Dyson, solving robotic-simulation-esque problems along with some MyDyson cloud stuff too.

In my free time I love to watch movies, listening/creating music, bouldering and being in nature.

I have no affiliation with [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/vandamdinh/), I just think it's an awesome platform and thought it'd be a cool challenge to recreate their site. Please don't sue me!
